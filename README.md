# Vulnerability Management App

## Description
The application analyzes a set of malicious URLs from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity
([University of new Brunswick](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html?fbclid=IwAR10CyWXdYX_d9hqTG5xUKb_U15gg816xMAcTugrauLlAxdiRZk72HqYWAY)).
The dataset contains around 165.000 URLs, split in 5 categories: benign, spam, phishing, malware and defacement URLs.

The dataset is read from the files and stored in a SQLite DB.

| URL_type | URL |
| -------- | --- |
| id (PK) | id (PK) |
| name | path |
| | accessed_on |
| | ip |
| | url_type_id (FK) |

The `url.accessed_on` and `url.ip` are randomized fields.

Vulnerability Management App consists of two main screens available after the login:
* *Malicious URLs occurrences over the year* - we split the dataset in 5 categories
  and display their occurrences in each quarter of the year.
 
* *Monthly report of Safe/Malicious URLs* - we use only the phishing urls set and validate
  it using a custom algorithm, resulting in two categories: Safe and Malicious URLs. These are
  also displayed as a monthly report, based on the date the urls were accessed.
